    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">EDT Keypad navigation is from a time before
      keyboards had arrow keys let alone PageUp/Down keys. DEC software
      engineers made efficient use of the numeric keypad that was added for data
      entry users. Instead of a big plus key there was a minus and comma key.
      The top 4 keys were not math operators; rather they were PF-1 through
      PF-4. In order they were GOLD, HELP, Find, Delete Line. </p>
    <p>Unlike a PC where you have to hold down <ctrl> and another key, you
        simply press and release the GOLD key then press and release the key for
        the function you want. <b>The text that doesnâ€™t have a gold background
          is what they key does when the GOLD key was not pressed in front of
          it.</b></ctrl></p>
    <p>Because some EDT emulation modes on some editors, notably Emacs, are
      unable to map the NumLock key as GOLD, the Option dialog allows you to
      choose between NumLock and ScrollLock as your GOLD key.</p>
    <p>EDT mode is direction maintaining. The default direction is Advance [the
      4 key]. You can change the direction to Backup by hitting the 5 key. All
      of your navigation operations will continue in that direction until you
      change direction again.</p>
    <h3>All you really need to know is HELP
    </h3>
    <p>The PF2 key [/ on the PC keypad] brings up this Help text. Many a
      programmer learned EDT without access to a printed manual and before the
      Internet was even a dream. The Help screen had the keypad image you see
      here and just a few lines of text explaining a few cryptic things. We
      didn't have screen capture utilities on those green serial terminals, but
      some of them had an extra serial port for a printer. Many a developer used
      the magic terminal key combination to print the Help screen on an attached
      printer then hung it in their cubicle. This Help screen has far more
      information than we ever had.</p>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> Because EDT was from a time before desktop computers or the
      concept of desktop software, there was no OS or desktop level clipboard.
      EDT was a mult-buffer editor ahead of its time. Today you have multiple
      tabs and think nothing of it. One buffer that was always created was
      PASTE. When you selected and cut text it went here. You could append to
      it, view it, and even edit it. This EDT emulation will use the system
      supplied clipboard. It will let you append and view the clipboard
      contents.</p>
    <p>EDT became a favorite editor for tens of thousands of developers. It
      wasn't "expert friendly" like most of the editors then and now. All you
      needed was that screen print and someone telling you how to exit and save.
      All of the most used things were on the keypad. There were only a token
      few commands to execute at the command prompt and you didn't need them
      very often. You only had to know one: EXIT</p>
    <p>In general, just be aware that most of the "delete" functions can be
      undone using GOLD and the same key. The exception is DEL EOL which is
      discussed later.</p>

            to provide the page breaks in the source. This is still really handy
            when working with languages or data that has defined sections. By

            most used value historically was 12 for ASCII FormFeed because that
            was used by the PAGE key to identify the start of another page. Some

            directionally sensitive "next" character. When you have a current

    <p><b>COMMAND</b> There are a small number of EDT commands that would still
      prove useful in this day and age, but none have been implemented.</p>
    <p><b>SUBS</b> By today's standard this was a complex key sequence for
      making a text substitution then finding the next matching text. I spent 20
      years on DEC platforms and never used it. The SUBS command was much easier
      and less prone to user error. When you hit the SUBS key combination you
      will be presented with the "Find" dialog</p>

      width="350" height="400" align="left">
    <p><b>FILL</b> In the very old days when we never turned on wordwrap for
      fear of forgetting it and trashing a large source file, FILL was
      necessary. You selected a bunch of lines and it would "pack" as many words
      as possible without splitting a word on each line. When we only had an 80
      column screen and narrow continuous form only allowed for 80 printed
      columns this was how we made our documentation look like we cared. Today
      you have wordwrap and many free word processors. This editor has wordwrap
      and spell check. It also has a rewrap option on the context menu. It just
      wasn't worth the effort to implement FILL.</p>
    <h3 style="text-align:center">Some Apple/MAC users will be a bit hosed</h3>
    <p>Most of you probably won't be impacted. If you have on of the Apple/MAC
      keyboards that sends the numeric keypad modifier with every arrow key then
      you won't be able to hit the EDT SELECT key and use the arrow keys to make
      your selection. This could also impact certain laptop users where the
      keyboard doesn't have an independent numeric keypad. <b>EDT Navigation is
        meant to be used with a numeric keypad.</b> If your OS or keyboard had
      to do something cute to simulate such a thing you probably shouldn't turn
      on the support. You can still navigate by character, line, and word; you
      just have to use the EDT keys.</p>
